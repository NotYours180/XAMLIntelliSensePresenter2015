# XAML IntelliSense Presenter 2015
Provides custom IntelliSense viewer for the Visul Studio 2015 XAML Editor. Features include camel case lookup, optional narrowing filter and several optional filters to limit items listed.

## PLEASE READ

If you elect to download the source and possibly modify to meet your needs, you MUST uninstall the Extension if you used the VSIX to install it.

Additionally, I got burned when I first started this project and I had been studying a sample on CodePlex. If you want to develop your own extension, be sure the following folder is cleared out before you start a new project. If you have a conflicting project, i.e. another IntelliSense extension in the below folder, you could get conflicts when debugging.

C:\Users\<your login in name is here>\AppData\Local\Microsoft\VisualStudio\14.0Exp\Extensions
